# EXPERIMENT 2

Date: January 22, 2026

## **Docker Installation, Configuration, and Running Images**

### **Aim / Objective:** To install and configure Docker, pull images from Docker Hub, run containers with port mapping, and perform container lifecycle management operations such as start, stop, remove, and image deletion.

---

### **Software & Hardware Requirements**

| **Component** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| Host OS | macOS (Apple Silicon – ARM64) |
| Container Platform | Docker Engine / Docker Desktop |
| Image Used | nginx |
| Terminal | macOS Terminal |
| Internet | Required (for pulling images) |

## **Theory**

### **Docker**

**Docker** is an open-source containerization platform used to build, ship, and run applications inside lightweight, isolated environments called containers. It ensures applications run consistently across different systems by packaging code, dependencies, and runtime together.

---

### **Image**

A **Docker Image** is a **read-only template** that contains the application code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration needed to run a container.

Images are built once and can be reused to create multiple containers.

Example: nginx:latest, ubuntu:24.04

---

### **Container**

A **Container** is a **running instance of a Docker image**.

It is lightweight, isolated, and shares the host operating system kernel while running independently from other containers.

Key points:

- Fast startup
- Portable across environments
- Uses fewer resources than virtual machines

---

### **Port Mapping**

**Port mapping** connects a port on the host machine to a port inside the container, allowing external access to services running inside the container.

Example:

```powershell
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
```

- 8080 → Host port
- 80 → Container port

This allows accessing the containerized application via:

```powershell
http://localhost:8080
```

### **Docker Lifecycle**

The typical **container lifecycle** follows these stages:

1. **Create** – Container is created from an image.
2. **Run** – Container starts executing the application.
3. **Stop** – Execution is paused or terminated.
4. **Remove** – Container is deleted when no longer needed.

---

## Procedure

### **Step 1 — Pull Docker Image**

```powershell
docker pull nginx
```

![image.png](EXPERIMENT%202/image.png)

Downloads the official nginx image from Docker Hub.

---

### **Step 2 — Run Container with Port Mapping**

```powershell
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nginx-container nginx
```

![image.png](EXPERIMENT%202/image%201.png)

- d → detached mode
- p 8080:80 → host port 8080 mapped to container port 80
- -name → custom container name

---

### **Step 3 — Verify Running Container**

```powershell
docker ps
```

![image.png](EXPERIMENT%202/image%202.png)

Then verify Nginx:

```powershell
curl localhost:8080
```

![image.png](EXPERIMENT%202/image%203.png)

OR open browser:

```powershell
http://localhost:8080
```

![image.png](EXPERIMENT%202/image%204.png)

You should see “Welcome to nginx!”

---

### **Step 4 — Stop Container**

```powershell
docker stop nginx-container
```

```powershell
ananyakarn@Ananyas-MacBook-Air-2 containerisation-devOps-AnanyaKarn-500125205-B3-ccvt % docker stop nginx-container
nginx-container
ananyakarn@Ananyas-MacBook-Air-2 containerisation-devOps-AnanyaKarn-500125205-B3-ccvt % 
```

---

### **Step 5 — Remove Container**

```powershell
docker rm nginx-container
```

```powershell
ananyakarn@Ananyas-MacBook-Air-2 containerisation-devOps-AnanyaKarn-500125205-B3-ccvt % docker rm nginx-container
nginx-container
ananyakarn@Ananyas-MacBook-Air-2 containerisation-devOps-AnanyaKarn-500125205-B3-ccvt % 
```

---

### **Step 6 — Remove Image**

```powershell
docker rmi nginx
```

```powershell
ananyakarn@Ananyas-MacBook-Air-2 containerisation-devOps-AnanyaKarn-500125205-B3-ccvt % docker rmi nginx
Untagged: nginx:latest
Deleted: sha256:341bf0f3ce6c5277d6002cf6e1fb0319fa4252add24ab6a0e262e0056d313208
ananyakarn@Ananyas-MacBook-Air-2 containerisation-devOps-AnanyaKarn-500125205-B3-ccvt % 
```

If image in use → stop/remove container first.

---

## **Container Lifecycle Summary**

Image → Container Created → Running → Stopped → Removed

---

## **Observations**

Example points:

- Image pulled successfully from Docker Hub
- Container exposed nginx service on port 8080
- docker ps shows active containers
- Containers start quickly with minimal overhead

---

### Result

Docker image was successfully pulled, container executed with port mapping, verified through browser output, and lifecycle operations (stop, remove, image removal) were completed successfully.
